# QUESTION
"""
Alice has some cards with numbers written on them. 
She arranges the cards in decreasing order, and lays them out face down in a sequence on a table. 
She challenges Bob to pick out the card containing a given number by turning over as few cards as possible. 
Write a function to help Bob locate the card.
"""

# QUESTION IN PLAIN
'''
We need to write a program to find the position of a given number in a list of numbers arranged in decreasing order. 
We also need to minimize the number of times we access elements from the list.
'''


# Possible variations
'''
The number query occurs somewhere in the middle of the list cards.
query is the first element in cards.
query is the last element in cards.
The list cards contains just one element, which is query.
The list cards does not contain number query.
The list cards is empty.
The list cards contains repeating numbers.
The number query occurs at more than one position in cards.
